# OTP-Display

<h2>Otp display is to show otps on screen. </h2>

Here we are retrieving otps that from Gmail so you would have to use Gmail API. and We are using web server OAuth API <i><b>not the limited input one</b></i>, because it is easy to use. 

1: Get get client_id and client_secret : from google console with "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly" scope.
2: Get Refresh token : from https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ to get the Refresh token (we do not need an access token not right know).
